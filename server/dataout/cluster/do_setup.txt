InOutTyp {io_args} Adresstype {addr_args}

InOutTyp:
ringbuffer, stream, cluster, filebuffer

Adresstype:
raw, modul, driver_mapped, driver_mixed, driver_syscall,
socket, localsocket, file, tape, null

io_args: buffsize wieviel opt_io_args

buffsize: Groesse des io-Buffers (ignored (?) in case of cluster)
wieviel:  how many data to send
    0: all data
  n>0: n events
   -1: all data, but errors are not fatal

opt_io_args:
 -----
 associated with filebuffer:
 [0]  -1: master-dataout for this buffer
    n>=0: slave belonging to dataout n
 [1...] : (string) directoryname for filebuffer

addr_args:
  depending on Addresstype

opt_addr_args: (only for cluster with tape)
 [0]   n: tape density code (0 is default)
 the following flag is hardly used; it should be removed in the near future
 [1]   1: write filemarks even if forbidden on command line
